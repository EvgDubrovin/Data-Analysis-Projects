Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. Also, we know that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.  \nThe finance team have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. The management believes the company can increase profits by maximizing the number of annual memberships.  \nTherefore, I have to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently and how we can convert casual riders into annual members by a new marketing strategy.

recommendations on how to convert casual customers to members:  \n#### **1. A weekend offer.**  \nMost \"popular days\" are saturday and sunday. We can implement a new type of less expensive membership: for those who will use bikes only (or mostly) on weekends. Or give some bonuses for weekend members like extra minutes or discount.  \n#### **2. A seasonal offer.**  \nExtra minutes, discount or free water (we've seen a decrease of ride length during a heat) for summer or spring members.  \n#### **3. Special hours offer.**  \nThe peak time of biking is from 3 PM to 6 PM. We can offer some bonuses, like a free hour (or 30 minutes), at this time for members.  \nBecause of casual users tend to ride longer trips, we might suggest some bonuses for trips longer than 30 minutes.  \n#### **4. Geotargeting advertisement**  \nWe can use digital media for geotargeting advertising near the most popular stations. Stations with over 20,000 total rides: \"Streeter Dr & Grand Ave\", \"Millenium Park\", \"Michigan Ave & Oak St\", \"Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St\", \"Shedd Aquarium\" and \"Theater on the Lake\".  \nAlso, suggest some extra bonuses (like a coupon in a local store) for new members.  \n#### **5. Bike types offers**  \nSince electric bikes are less popular for casual customers, we can upgrade them with some extra features to emphasize it's merit. E.g. sightseeing guide (via the app, QR-code or built-in headphones) or travel routes navigator, etc.  \nDocked bikes are \"champions\" by ride duration. So we can offer some bonuses (lower price, discount, free minutes, a free water bottle, etc.) for members who ride long trips.  \nClassic bikes are already the most popular, but we can consider to implement all listed above options for classic bikes member users.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### THANK YOU!","metadata":{}}]}
