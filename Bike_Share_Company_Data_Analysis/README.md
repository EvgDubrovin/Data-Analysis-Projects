### Description
  
This is a Google data analytics certificate (from Coursera) case study project, made in ***R***. 

According to the scenario, I'm a junior data analyst in the marketing team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company from Chicago.  
I have to understand how casual riders and annual members use a bike-sharing company differently and how we can convert casual riders into annual members by a new marketing strategy.  
To do this, I analyzed the company's historical bike trip data and made my recommendations.

What i did:
* Data merging from different .csv files
* Data cleaning and validating
* EDA
* Customer behavior analysis
* Recommendations on how to convert casual customers to members.
