# Data Analysis Projects
Here are some data analysis projects I made.
  
## Bike_Share_Company_Data_Analysis  

This is a Google data analytics certificate (from Coursera) case study project, made in R. I had to understand how casual riders and annual members use a bike-sharing company differently and how we can convert casual riders into annual members by a new marketing strategy. To do this, I analyzed the company's historical bike trip data.

## EDA_Titanic_Dataset

EDA practice on a famous titanic dataset.

## Trips_Scraper

Two scripts for fast auto searching of best tickets (planes and trains) for business trips. Made with Selenium.
