# Data_Analysis_Projects
Here are some data analysis projects I made.

Sorry, my Kaggle notebook can't be shown here right now, because the files are too big. I'll try to figure it out. For now, here's the link to my Kaggle notebook - https://www.kaggle.com/evgenevgen/bike-share-company-data-analysis-gdac-cs1  
(A quick description of this project.  
This was a Google data analytics certificate (from Coursera) case study project. I had to understand how casual riders and annual members use a bike-sharing company differently and how we can convert casual riders into annual members by a new marketing strategy. To do this, I analyzed the company's historical bike trip data).
