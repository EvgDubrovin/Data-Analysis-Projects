# Data_Analysis_Projects
Here are some data analysis projects I made.
  
## Bike-Share Company Data Analysis  

This was a Google data analytics certificate (from Coursera) case study project, made in R. I had to understand how casual riders and annual members use a bike-sharing company differently and how we can convert casual riders into annual members by a new marketing strategy. To do this, I analyzed the company's historical bike trip data.
